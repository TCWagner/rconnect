Description: Derives the raster based connectivity metrics 'effective seedrain', 'effective connections' and 'effective distance'.
      This metrics are particularly useful when assessing connectivity of riverscapes for wind dispersed plant species. 
      The metrics fill the gap between common connectivity indices for rivers that focus on the passage for fish 
      and terrestrial connectivity indices such as nearest neighbor distances, 'CCP', 'LCP' or 'IIC' (Pascual-Hortal, L., and Saura, S. 2006; <doi:10.1007/s10980-006-0013-z>) 
      that do not consider the particularities of riverscapes. The metrics are available at landscape, patch and cell level an can be combined with 
      different weights and cost paths. The raster output can be used for modeling.
      Known dispersal distance of the species under consideration and raster with suitable habitat patches (coded with a value > 0) 
      are required. A negative exponential dispersal kernel can be created with the function dispersalKernel. Other kernels can be
      provided as matrix. Wagner, T. C., & Woellner, R. (2022).
